Apart from my career goals, I want to enjoy life and be a good person. Dream number one on my agenda is to ride a hot air balloon.
 I want to feel the sensation of lifting off in a basket and moving along with the flow of the air. 
Then, in my time off during the summers I want to travel the around the world. 
The top four places I have in mind now are the Holy Land (Israel), Rome (Italy), Machu Picchu (Perú), and Spain.
 After a couple of years working as a teacher, I want to open a learning center in my dad’s village,
 in Guanajuato (México). Since it is a village there are not a lot of educational resources.
 I want to make a center where children can go after school to obtain the resources to complete their homework and expand their knowledge.
 I also want to have classes for the adults where they can learn to read or write, provide them with access to information, and guide them to the proper services.
